												<h1> 

												</h1>
											  <p>
												My vision is creative and futuristic. 
												I enjoy thinking out of the box and have a niche for picking up trends. 
												My goal : to create something that makes people feel alive. 
												I want people to not only see something, but also feel. Surely, leisure and the ways in which people feel the most alive differ. 
												However, personally, the combination of art and technology, pyrotechnics, film effects, and virtual reality are some of the things which have captured my eye. 
												I get a rush of adrenaline seeing such things. 
												It makes me ecstatic and inspired. I want to be part of that world . 
												For that reason, I would love to work in media related industries that have like minded people who also contribute to enhancing joy with their innovation and ideas. 
												I hope to work in an environment which prioritizes a sense of providing community and bringing about positive experience to users. What I can bring to the table is creativity, collaboration, and an authentic and intuitive character.
