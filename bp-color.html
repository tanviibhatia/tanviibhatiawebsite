                                                        Pink is the smell of jasmine flowers. Pink is feeling the sun on a spring day with perfect temperature. Pink feels like silk. Pink is the feeling of a little girl watching Disney princess movies in awe of such magic. Pink is a toddler running up to give you a hug. 
                                                    </p>

                                                        White feels like the most comfortable sleep. White is smooth and clean. White is a person who brightens up the whole room. White is classy. White smells like Aveeno Coconut Body Wash or clean warm clothes out of the dryer. Adding white to any other color lightens it. White opens up the dimensions of a room.

                                                        Purple is giving your best friend a hug. Purple is an acquired taste. It is like foods that people either love or hate. It feels like the petals of a bouquet of flowers. Purple has character, but it is not understood by everyone. Purple is cold on the outside yet very warm once you get to know it. Purple tastes like a lavender and honey latte. Purple is listening to music in the car with the windows down.

                                                        Red is giving your mom a hug. Red is hot chocolate on a cold but beautiful ski day. Red is the feeling of love. Red is the way your heart feels when you listen to your favorite song. Red is sitting next to the fireplace. Red is a hot and relaxing shower. Red can hurt too. It can either smell like roses, or blood. It can fill your heart or it can break it. One must treat red with caution.
