                                                    As a second year in college, my thoughts and lifestyle are often in places I never perceived them to be. No one really prepares you for college - the mental, emotional, and academic whirlwind of a life away from authority, rules, and structure. Especially during the entrance of a Pandemic my first year, I think it's safe to say that students of my year have had an unusual, non traditional college experience. So what is it like? Of course, everyone’s experience is unique. Some love it from the beginning, some despise it the first semester and then fall in love, and others encounter their own journey. Personally, the first year of college was the best year of my life. The extreme positive emotions I encountered were ones that I never knew existed. Happy? Not strong enough of a word. Maybe blissful. Content. Peaceful. Confident. Where these emotions stemmed from? Initially, it was the new environment, new people, warm weather (coming from New England to Georgia), passion to begin a new life, eagerness to meet new people, excitement to leave the small, sheltered, non diverse place of an institution called high school. Then, it became my drive to follow and maximize the above stated factors. And surely, I encountered wonderful people. People met through organizations, Greek life, and mutual friends. And whether it was a coffee run and conversation, a random night that ended up with four girls in a dorm discussing our opinion on the election, a study session at 3 am in the library with loads of snacks from the vending machine, or a familiar face seen weekly at a fraternity event, I enjoyed every interaction. Although I may not have gotten along or “vibed” with every person, my confidence built as I stepped out of my comfort zone and began to make strangers my friends and experience this opportunity called college. To make things a bit better, COVID-19 halted in person classes… and while there are certain downfalls to this virtual environment, the healing that it had on my mental state was substantial. As an extremely anxious person, not having to worry about waking up an hour before class, pick out an outfit (which was a new change coming from 12 years of a uniform) to get ready and walk to class, worry about the construct of time, or opinions of every student (which was difficult to avoid at my graduating high school class of 150 students), had a profound effect. Not only was I able to manage my academic life, but I was also able to build confidence and feel in control of my life. In addition, I was able to explore the city of Atlanta, take class in cozy cafes, and become an independent young adult whilst learning how to do the laundry, make sure I was eating properly, and making sure I was implementing at least 10,000 steps daily. Living this way was rewarding. For the first time, I felt valued. The people in my life genuinely complimented me and were excited to see me, advisors of clubs recognized my enthusiasm and outgoingness, and conversations during office hours with professors excited me. Most importantly, my core friends became the best relationships I had ever formed. They made life pretty. And as someone who values people more than alone time, the new sense of comfort I formed with people in college felt better than what was home in Massachusetts. 

                                                So, this high on life lasted for a good ten months. But like everything, change is inevitable. And the change that proceeded has been difficult. 

                                                Although my second year, this new adjustment to non-COVID college was difficult. I began to understand the tik toks I saw of students craving home, loneliness at college, and struggle. The first factor for this change - in person classes. Indeed, I began to wake up early, shower and get ready, and then enter a classroom of 100 unfamiliar faces. And first year Tanvi would make it a priority to reach out and make friends in class. And to an extent, I did. However, in the past year, I too had changed in ways I never saw coming. Perhaps I got too comfortable. I didn’t care  much about making surface level friendships with classmates. I lacked the desire to meet new people as I once did. Where this flame slowly burned out, I’m not sure; however, during the process I slightly lost myself. Classes were difficult. I hated what I was learning. I began questioning the "American" education system and became frustrated with core classes that I would never use in the real world. I recognized that I was no longer the happy girl that looked forward to waking up every morning. Rather, I fell into depression naps, inability to focus in class, and frustration when I was unable to understand the matrices in linear algebra or Javascript programming language. People did say Tech was hard, and I began to see why. Then I began to question why I was even at this school. My passions lie outside of the engineering fields. However, the conclusion after multiple discussions with my parents was to just try my best, take care of my mental health, and come out with a degree. This change in the expectation was definitely relieving to hear. For the first time, my mental health was prioritized as (if not more important) than the idea of straight As. 

                                                Yet, for some reason the change in lifestyle was overwhelming. The regular anxiety of life came back. Social anxiety instilled in ways I had never experienced. The fifteen minute walk to class was undesirable. The crowded library of students not looking up from their laptop depressed me. The changes in dynamics with friends frustrated me. The resulting amount of tears that fell down my face irritated me. And the lack of confidence and drive to do anything put me in a low place. So, although I am still in this funk, I’m sure a lesson will come out of this time. And I have been attempting to plan for a better upcoming future. I have been trying to remind myself of what makes me happy (listed in another post), put exercise back into practice, create goals, find outlets of creativity to calm my anxiety, try new things like yoga, and take care of myself as I used to. Slowly, but surely I will get back there. And I am excited to see what the new year will hold as I force myself out of this chapter.
